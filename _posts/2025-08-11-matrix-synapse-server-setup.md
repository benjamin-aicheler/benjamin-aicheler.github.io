I have recently deployed a personal [Matrix Synapse](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/server/synapse) homeserver, embracing the principles of federated, end-to-end encrypted communication. This move allows for greater control and sovereignty over my personal data.

The entire stack is containerized using Docker and orchestrated via `docker-compose` for a reproducible and maintainable setup.

Check the [Docker Repository](https://github.com/benjamin-aicheler/docker) for details.
