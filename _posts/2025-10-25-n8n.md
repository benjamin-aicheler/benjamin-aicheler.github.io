The evolution of my homelab continues! This time, I've deployed a self-hosted [n8n](https://n8n.io/) instance. n8n is a powerful workflow automation tool, often described as an open-source, self-hostable alternative to services like Zapier or IFTTT.

This addition allows me to connect various applications and services, design complex automated workflows with its visual editor, and maintain full control over my data and integrations. It's the perfect engine for automating repetitive tasks in my digital life.

Check the [K3s Repository](https://github.com/benjamin-aicheler/k3s) for configuration details.
