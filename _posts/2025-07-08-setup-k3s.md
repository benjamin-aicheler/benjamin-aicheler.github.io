Currently I'm working on setting up a K3s cluster to learn some Kubernetes and maybe selfhost some services.

* Mini-PC Intel N100, 16GB RAM
* Proxmox
* 3 Ubuntu Server VM
* 3 K3s Server Nodes

While I feel the hardware would be more suitable for a standalone setup, it's working so far. If you're interested, you can find some shell scripts and yaml files in my [K3s Repository](https://github.com/benjamin-aicheler/k3s). There are still some issues I'm working out, though.
