I've taken the next step in my homelab journey by deploying a self-hosted [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) instance. This powerful open-source platform allows me to centralize control of all my smart home devices, create complex automations, and most importantly, keep all my data local and private.

Check the [K3s Repository](https://github.com/benjamin-aicheler/k3s) for configuration details.
