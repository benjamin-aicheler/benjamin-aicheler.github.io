This site needed a new look, so I enlisted the help of Gemini to customize a blog layout based on the classic Minima theme.

The goal was a clean, simple design that puts the content first, and I was impressed with how effectively it translated the requirements into a functional layout. It's a great demonstration of using AI as a development partner for rapid prototyping.
